# Opting into Beta Functionality coming in version 3.0 of the Azure Provider

Version 3.0 of the Azure Provider will introduce several new features ([full details can be found in the 3.0 Upgrade Guide](/docs/providers/azurerm/guides/3.0-upgrade-guide.html)):

- New Data Sources and Resources for App Service and Function Apps
- Soft Delete Recovery/Purging for Certificates, Keys and Secrets
- Switching to Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL)
- Updates to existing behaviours for Application Gateway, API Management, Resource Groups, Storage, among others

Since both Azure and Terraform's Azure Provider move quickly - in order to continue rapidly shipping new features we've used Feature Toggles to gradually add support for the new functionality coming in version 3.0 of the Azure Provider as we've been developing 2.x versions of the Azure Provider.

What this means is that the most recent 2.x versions of the Azure Provider are able to opt-into certain functionality coming in version 3.0 of the Azure Provider.

This guide details how to enable these features and how you can submit feedback prior to the final release.

## Disclaimers

-> The functionality provided in this Beta is subject to change - as such we recommend **not using this Beta in Production**.

-> Whilst certain feature flags may be available in earlier versions of the Azure Provider they existed in an incomplete manner - **the Beta is only supported when using version 2.97 (or later) of the Azure Provider**.

-> The final 3.0 release will contain the [deprecations and resource removals outlined in the 3.0 Upgrade Guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/guides/3.0-upgrade-guide).

## New Data Sources and Resources for App Service

Version 3.0 of the Azure Provider will introduce support for several new resources, which supersede the existing App Service resources.

Instructions on how to *only* opt into the new App Service Resources Beta can be found over on the page [Opting into the new App Service Resources Beta](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/guides/3.0-app-service-beta).

## 3.0 Features, Removals and Deprecations 

It's possible to opt into the Beta by setting the Environment Variable `ARM_THREEPOINTZERO_BETA` to `true`.

On a macOS/Linux system you can do this via:

```bash
export ARM_THREEPOINTZERO_BETA=true
```

On a Windows System (in PowerShell) you can do this via:

```powershell
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('ARM_THREEPOINTZERO_BETA', 'true', [System.EnvironmentVariableTarget]::User)
```

-> **Note:** You may need to reload/re-open your Terminal after setting this Environment Variable.

---

You can opt-out of this Beta by either removing the Environment Variable or setting it to `false`.

On a macOS/Linux system you can do this via:

```bash
export ARM_THREEPOINTZERO_BETA=false
```

On a Windows System (in PowerShell) you can do this via:

```powershell
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('ARM_THREEPOINTZERO_BETA', 'false', [System.EnvironmentVariableTarget]::User)
```

---

-> **Note:** If this Environment Variable isn't specified, you'll see an error that looks similar to the one below when trying to use any of the new App Service Resources, since the Azure Provider will Disable them:

```
$ terraform plan

Error: Invalid resource type

  on main.tf line 1, in resource "azurerm_function_app_active_slot" "test":
   1: resource "azurerm_function_app_active_slot" "test" {

The provider provider.azurerm does not support resource type
"azurerm_function_app_active_slot".
```

## Providing Feedback
