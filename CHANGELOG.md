## 2.41.0 (December 17, 2020)

UPGRADE NOTES:

* `azurerm_key_vault` - Azure will be introducing a breaking change on December 31st, 2020 by force-enabling Soft Delete on all new and existing Key Vaults. To workaround this, this release of the Azure Provider still allows you to configure Soft Delete on before this date (but once this is enabled this cannot be disabled). Since new Key Vaults will automatically be provisioned using Soft Delete in the future, and existing Key Vaults will be upgraded - a future release will deprecate the `soft_delete_enabled` field and default this to true early in 2021. ([#9911](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-azurerm/issues/9911))
* `azurerm_key_vault_certificate` - Terraform will now attempt to `purge` Certificates during deletion due to the upcoming breaking change in the Azure API where Key Vaults will have soft-delete force-enabled. This can be disabled by setting the `purge_soft_delete_on_destroy` field within the `features -> keyvault` block to `false`. ([#9911](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-azurerm/issues/9911))
* `azurerm_key_vault_key` - Terraform will now attempt to `purge` Keys during deletion due to the upcoming breaking change in the Azure API where Key Vaults will have soft-delete force-enabled. This can be disabled by setting the `purge_soft_delete_on_destroy` field within the `features -> keyvault` block to `false`. ([#9911](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-azurerm/issues/9911))
* `azurerm_key_vault_secret` - Terraform will now attempt to `purge` Secrets during deletion due to the upcoming breaking change in the Azure API where Key Vaults will have soft-delete force-enabled. This can be disabled by setting the `purge_soft_delete_on_destroy` field within the `features -> keyvault` block to `false`. ([#9911](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-azurerm/issues/9911))
